# To be able to calculate CG, to be able to size/cut/drill x gantry
## print
z-rail-mounting-plate * 2
z-nut-housing-mounting-plate * 1
x-nut-housing-mounting-plate * 1
## then measure weights and arms

xy-gantry-extrusion-to-bearing-block-attachment * 4
xy-gantry-nut-housing-mounting-plate * 1


use braces/triangle to hold z-stepper-plate extrusions more firmly in place?
for z-stepper, cut channels not holes to accommodate the eventual switch to aluminum for nut housing

Check screw lengths

End stop switch mounts
